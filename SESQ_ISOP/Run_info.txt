New base for new PCs:

- redefine original subroutine 'RANDOM' as 'RANDOMNUM' for compatability with new libraries
- includes DMS chem
- includes ISOP recycling 

Base_test:
- all STOCHEM inputs moved to a central EMDIR, relevant path names changed
- some files previous in DATDIR (LAND_BIG.DAT, OZ_BIG.DAT, LS100BIG.DAT, LS56BIG.DAT,
stat10_soa.dat) changed to EMDIR, now DATDIR calls the inputs in the new scenrion files 
(i.e. chem10_soa, flux10_OH, BINFILE)
- running to confirm everything works fine (12/02/25), everything fine (14/02/2025)

NEW BASE:
Emissions - 
- Veg emissions taken from MEGAN 2012 (https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/5/1471/2012/gmd-5-1471-2012.pdf)
- Veg emissions previously in STOCHEM with no update in MEGAN have be assumed to be artefacts of old
updates and removed
- Only chemicals with speciated emissions given in MEGAN have been updated (those included in VOC categories have been ignored)
- EXCEPTION: monoterpene total emissions are summed and split 2:1, alpha:beta-pinene 
- With these updates to vegetation emissons, our model contains ~94% of biogenic emissions predicted by MEGAN
Kinetics - 
- JPL 19-5 (2019- https://jpldataeval.jpl.nasa.gov/pdf/NASA-JPL%20Evaluation%2019-5.pdf) used for updates of HCHO, AONE and ACET 
photolysis AND kinetic data for VOC + OH 
- updated values found in ../Update_docs
- photolysis values interpolated to each wavelength listed in LAMBDA DATA expression (rather than previously used method of 
treating lambda values as midoints of 'bins' and averaging)
- added additional photolysis route for ACET (-> CH4 + CO)
